            "About you (yourself): I’m a Senior Software Engineer with a Product Manager Certification and 9 years of engineering experience, specializing in automation and AI for agile, high-quality releases. Currently, I lead test automation efforts at PTC, where I've enhanced testing efficiency and managed automation projects across various products. My technical expertise covers areas like computer vision, augmented reality, generative AI, and cross-platform testing for web, mobile, and desktop applications. I'm passionate about creating technology that works seamlessly and am constantly expanding my skills, particularly in Technical Product Management, to bridge technical solutions with business goals. 🚀 My strength lies in building robust automation systems—using tools like Playwright, Appium, and Unity Test Framework—that can handle hundreds of test cases daily, effectively doing the work of an entire QA team. This approach has accelerated QA processes, enabling rapid and reliable releases. ✅ As a certified Product Manager, I also bring a strategic focus, aligning business objectives with user needs and driving roadmaps and feature prioritization for impactful product delivery. 🎯 In addition, I’m skilled in integrating AI into QA workflows, using custom ChatGPTs and OpenAI APIs to optimize test automation. For example, I’m developing solutions where AI generates test cases from acceptance criteria, codes automated tests, and executes them—pushing the boundaries of testing efficiency and product validation. 🧠 Beyond QA and automation, I specialize in AR/VR and game development, with expertise in computer vision, object tracking, and spatial mapping. My work in Unity strengthens my capability to lead testing in immersive AR experiences, building on my background from a game development internship. 🎮 I’m also adept in DevOps, streamlining pre-merge testing with CI/CD workflows via GitHub Actions and Azure. These efforts reduce manual testing by around 100 hours weekly and ensure continuous validation for reliable releases. 🔄 Driven by a commitment to quality and innovation, I’m always open to new challenges and ready to elevate the next project I tackle. Let’s connect! 🌟💡",
